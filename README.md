# FELLAS, we are producing chocolates now

The chart that we are making is called a statistical process control chart, or sometimes just short control chart. It is a standard tool used by quality managers in a manufacturing environment, for instance, let's assume we are producing a chocolate bar. We should aim for a target weight of 50g, but we can still accept maybe everything between 48g and 52g. Often they are not going to weight each and every chocolate bar, instead on regular intervals they will take a batch, weigh them and take the average. That average is plotted on the chart, as we are doing now. So here we have `target = 50`, `lower control limit = 48` and `upper control limit = 52`. If an average is outside the limits, it indicates an issue with the production line, but there could be also other issues, even if all values are within the limits. For instance, if we see all values above the target, we should adjust the machine, because the bars are consistently too heavy.


* [This video explains the process visually.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ugcb7Vlp0Ts)
* We can divide the plot into different zones

* [here](https://www.sixsigma-institute.org/Six_Sigma_DMAIC_Process_Control_Phase_SPC_Out_Of_Control.php) are 7 rules
   that you will be implementing.

> we have,</br>
> TARGET = 40</br>
> UPPER ZONE C: 40 - 41</br>
> UPPER ZONE B: 41- 42</br>
> UPPER ZONE A: 43 - 43</br>
> UCL: 43</br>
> LOWER ZONE C: 39 - 40</br>
> LOWER ZONE B: 38- 39</br>
> LOWER ZONE A: 37 - 38</br>
> LCL: 37 (edited)</br>

The final plot should look something like below ðŸ‘‡
